"""Feature extraction after Cen and Newman, ICRA 2018.

A faithful port of ``cpp/referee/src/features.cpp``, which is the code the RA-L
results were produced with. Two of its details are surprising and are kept
deliberately, because changing either changes published numbers:

* the smoothing kernel is a parabola, not a Gaussian. The Gaussian line is
  present in the C++ but commented out, and ``(i - mu)**2 / sigma**2``
  normalised to sum one is what actually runs.
* OpenCV's ``filter2D`` correlates rather than convolves. The kernel is
  symmetric, so this happens not to matter, but the port correlates too.
